# Evolution of Windows

![windows-evolution](./../../resources/windows-evolution.jpg)

Windows started out in 1985 as frontend for <u>MS-DOS</u>. Several versions of Windows followed and in 1993, a new version operating system for Windows was introduced based on a <u>NT-Kernel</u>, completely independent from MS-DOS.

> MS-DOS = Microsoft Disk Operating System

Since 2001, Windows has been based solely on <u>Windows OS</u>, starting with <u>Windows XP</u>, which was a huge success. Next came <u>Windows Vista</u>, which was unpopular and had performance issues. Similarly, <u>Windows 7</u> and <u>Windows 8</u> were quickly discontinued until <u>Windows 10</u> and <u>Windows 11</u>, which are available as **Home** and **Pro** versions.
