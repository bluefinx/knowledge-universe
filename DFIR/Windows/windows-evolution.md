# Evolution of Windows

![windows-evolution](./../../resources/windows-evolution.jpg)

Windows started out in 1985 as frontend for *MS-DOS*. Several versions of Windows followed and in 1993, a new version operating system for Windows was introduced based on a *NT-Kernel*, completely independent from MS-DOS.

Since 2001, Windows has been based solely on *Windows OS*, starting with *Windows XP*, which was a huge success. Next came *Windows Vista*, which was unpopular and had performance issues. Similarly, *Windows 7* and *Windows* 8 were quickly discontinued until *Windows 10* and *Windows 11*, which are available as **Home** and **Pro** versions.
